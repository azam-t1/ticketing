1. What diagram types do you have on your current project?
2. What are the pros and cons of UML diagrams?
3. What is the difference between a structural diagram and a behavioral diagram in UML?
4. Name the relationship types in a use case diagram
5. What is the sequence diagram?


1. Use case diagrams, sequence diagrams
2. Pros of UML Diagrams:
- Visual Representation of a System
- Standardization
- Abstraction: UML allows focusing on specific aspects of the system
- Documentation: UML diagrams serve as effective documentation
- Design Analysis: UML enables the analysis and validation of a system's design

Cons:
- Complexity: As a system grows, UML diagrams can become more difficult to manage.
- Potential Inconsistency: UML diagrams need to be regularly updated to reflect the current state
- Overuse or Misuse: can introduce unnecessary complexity into the project

3. Structural diagram focuses on static view of a system, Behavioral diagram focuses on dynamic view of a system

4. 5 relationships in use case diagram:
	1. Association between actor and use case
	2. Generalization of an actor
	3. Extend btw two use cases
	4. Include btw two use cases
	5. Generalization of a use case
        

5. Sequence diagram - shows how objects interact in a particular scenario
